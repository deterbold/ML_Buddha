  This app is an obscure, unfunny joke played on Nam June Paik's classic work
  <em>

    >TV Buddha</a
  ></em>.

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start the camera by tapping on the "Search for Buddha" button, and point it
    to a Buddha figure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the Machine Learning model has identified a Buddha figure, it will give
    you 10 seconds to turn the phone so you can use the front camera.
  </li>
  <li>
    Point the front camera to the Buddha statue. Sounds will play. Keep it
    there.
  </li>
  <li>It could be funny.</li>
  <li>
    If the Machine Learning model stops recognizing a Buddha, the app will
    return to searching mode.
  </li>
